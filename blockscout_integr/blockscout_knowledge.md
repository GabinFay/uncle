# Blockscout & Flow EVM Knowledge Base

## Overview
This document captures practical knowledge and insights from working with Blockscout explorer and Flow EVM testnet during smart contract development and deployment.

## Flow EVM Testnet Configuration

### Network Details
- **Network Name**: Flow EVM Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 545 
- **RPC URL**: `https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org`
- **Block Explorer**: `https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/`
- **Blockscout Instance**: `https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/` (Blockscout-powered)

### Key Characteristics
- Flow EVM is Ethereum-compatible but has some unique behaviors
- Transaction finality can be different from typical Ethereum testnets
- Gas pricing and block times may vary

## Blockscout Explorer Features

### Contract Verification
- Supports standard Solidity contract verification
- Requires source code, compiler version, and optimization settings
- Verified contracts show source code and enable direct interaction

### Transaction Tracking
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Detailed gas usage analytics
- Internal transaction tracing
- Event log decoding for verified contracts

### API Access
- RESTful API for programmatic access
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Standard Ethereum JSON-RPC compatibility

## Smart Contract Deployment Insights

### P2PLending Contract Deployment
- **Contract Address**: Successfully deployed on Flow EVM Testnet
- **Dependencies**: Uses OpenZeppelin contracts (ERC20, ReentrancyGuard, Ownable)
- **Gas Usage**: Standard deployment costs similar to other EVM networks

### Key Learnings from P2PLending
1. **Constructor Parameters**: Requires careful setup of:
   - UserRegistry address
   - Reputation contract address  
   - Payment token address (ERC20)
   - Optional ReputationOApp address

2. **Function Interactions**: 
   - `createLoanOffer()` function tested successfully
   - Requires proper ERC20 token approvals before calling
   - Events are properly emitted and visible in Blockscout

## Transaction Patterns Observed

### State Consistency
- Some transactions may not immediately reflect state changes in explorer
- Recommend waiting for block confirmations before assuming state updates
- Event logs are generally more reliable for tracking state changes

### Gas Optimization
- Flow EVM has competitive gas costs compared to Ethereum mainnet
- Standard optimization techniques apply (external calls, storage patterns)

## Development Best Practices

### Testing Strategy
1. **Local Development**: Use Anvil for initial testing
2. **Testnet Deployment**: Deploy to Flow EVM Testnet for integration testing
3. **Blockscout Verification**: Always verify contracts for easier debugging

### Debugging Workflow
1. Check transaction hash in Blockscout immediately after sending
2. Verify event emissions match expected behavior
3. Use internal transaction tracing for complex interactions
4. Cross-reference state changes with contract storage

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Transaction Visibility
- **Issue**: Transactions sometimes don't appear immediately in explorer
- **Solution**: Wait for 1-2 block confirmations, check using transaction hash directly

#### State Synchronization  
- **Issue**: Contract state may lag behind latest transactions
- **Solution**: Use event logs to track state changes, implement proper retry logic

#### Gas Estimation
- **Issue**: Gas estimates may vary from actual usage
- **Solution**: Add 10-20% buffer to gas estimates, monitor actual usage patterns

## Integration Patterns

### Frontend Integration
- Use Web3.js or Ethers.js with Flow EVM RPC endpoint
- Implement proper error handling for network-specific behaviors
- Cache frequently accessed data to reduce RPC calls

### Backend Services
- Leverage Blockscout API for transaction monitoring
- Implement webhook listeners for real-time event processing
- Use indexed event logs for efficient data retrieval

## Security Considerations

### Contract Verification
- Always verify contracts on Blockscout for transparency
- Ensure constructor parameters are publicly documented
- Test all public/external functions through Blockscout interface

### Transaction Monitoring
- Set up monitoring for critical contract events
- Implement alerting for unusual transaction patterns
- Regular security audits using Blockscout's transaction history

## Performance Optimization

### RPC Usage
- Batch multiple calls when possible
- Use event filtering to reduce data transfer
- Implement caching for immutable data

### Explorer Usage
- Bookmark frequently accessed contract addresses
- Use Blockscout's watch list feature for important contracts
- Leverage API keys for higher rate limits

## Future Considerations

### Mainnet Migration
- Flow mainnet deployment will require updated RPC endpoints
- Gas costs may differ between testnet and mainnet
- Additional security audits recommended for mainnet deployment

### Scaling Solutions
- Monitor for Flow-specific L2 solutions
- Consider event indexing services for high-volume applications
- Plan for potential network upgrades and migrations
