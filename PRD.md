# Product Requirements Document: Decentralized Credit Recovery

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a decentralized credit recovery platform aimed at helping individuals blacklisted from traditional financial systems in Brazil and globally. The platform will leverage cryptocurrency primitives to offer a path to rebuild creditworthiness.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide a viable mechanism for financially excluded individuals to rebuild their credit.
*   Offer a transparent and fair alternative to traditional credit scoring.
*   Create a system that is resistant to censorship and corruption.
*   Develop a solution that is scalable globally.
*   Qualify for multiple hackathon bounties by showcasing innovative use of blockchain technologies.

## 3. Target Audience

*   Individuals in Brazil (initially 65+ million) who are blacklisted by the traditional financial system.
*   Potentially, any individual worldwide facing similar financial exclusion.

## 4. Product Overview

The platform will be a decentralized application (dApp) enabling users to:
*   Receive social vouching from their network.
*   Submit alternative data for credit assessment.
*   Access micro-loans and gradually increase their borrowing capacity.
*   Build a portable, cross-chain credit reputation.

## 5. Key Features (as per initial vision)

*   **Social Vouching System:** Users' friends or contacts can stake tokens to vouch for their character and reliability.
*   **Alternative Credit Scoring:** An AI-powered system will analyze non-traditional data points like employment verification (e.g., via email proofs, vlayer) and utility payment history.
*   **Graduated Micro-Lending:** Users start with small loans (e.g., $50) and, upon successful repayment, can access larger loan amounts (up to $5000+). This will likely involve lending pools.
*   **Cross-Chain Reputation:** Credit history and scores will be portable across different blockchain networks, ensuring global usability and preventing data silos.
*   **Identity Management:** Integration with World ID for Sybil resistance.
*   **User Data Sovereignty:** Leveraging technologies like Filecoin to ensure users control their data.

## 6. Technology Stack (as per initial vision)

*   **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (for lending pools, reputation management, social vouching logic).
*   **Frontend:** React/Next.js, mobile-first design.
*   **Identity:** World ID.
*   **Alternative Data Verification:** vlayer (for employment, utility payments).
*   **AI Credit Risk Assessment:** Hedera (potentially leveraging AI agents).
*   **Cross-Chain Functionality:** LayerZero (for portable reputation).
*   **User Data Storage:** Filecoin.

## 7. Success Metrics

*   Number of users successfully rebuilding credit.
*   Volume of loans disbursed and repaid.
*   Growth in user base.
*   Positive user testimonials.
*   Successful qualification for hackathon bounties.
*   System uptime and security.

## 8. Future Considerations

*   Expansion to other geographical regions.
*   Integration with more data sources for credit assessment.
*   Partnerships with local organizations.
