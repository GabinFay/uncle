The Problem: Financial Apartheid in Brazil
65+ million Brazilians are permanently blacklisted from the financial system. Once you miss payments, you're banned from:

- Opening bank accounts
- Getting credit cards
- Starting businesses
- Building wealth

It's financial apartheid. Traditional systems offer no path back.

Our Solution: Decentralized Credit Recovery
A protocol that lets blacklisted people rebuild creditworthiness through:

- Social vouching (friends stake tokens instead of traditional collateral)
- Alternative data (employment proofs via email, utility payments)
- Micro-loan graduation (start with $50, build up to $5000+)
- Cross-chain reputation (portable credit history globally)

This literally couldn't exist without crypto. No traditional institution has incentive to serve this market.
