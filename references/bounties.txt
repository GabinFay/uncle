It allows developers to build omnichain applications (OApps) that can interact across multiple chains as if they were on a single chain. Why build with LayerZero at a hackathon — Reach More Users: Deploy your dApp once and interact with users and assets across all supported chains. — Unify Liquidity: Avoid fragmented liquidity; build DEXes, lending platforms, etc., that leverage a shared cross-chain pool. — Simplify Development: Build complex cross-chain logic using familiar tools (Hardhat, Foundry, etc.) and LayerZero's contract standards (OApp, OFT, ONFT). Get started quickly with the create-lz-oapp CLI. — Enhance Security: Benefit from a configurable, decentralized security model using Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs). — Improve User Experience: Abstract away cross-chain complexities, offering seamless interactions without users needing multiple wallets or bridging steps. — Innovate: Explore novel use cases like cross-chain governance, gaming, data queries (lzRead), and complex multi-step workflows (Composability). Prizes 📖 lzRead Track ⸺ $4,000 🥇 1st place $2,500 🥈 2nd place $1,500 Develop a comprehensive solution using LayerZero Read (lzRead) to request, retrieve, and process external on-chain state from destination blockchains. Your solution should use lzRead to perform cross-chain data queries and update state on the source or another destination chain based on the retrieved data.

Designed for simplicity and flexibility, Beraborrow features modular, tokenized components that can be composed together to introduce powerful new features to the CDP design space. Prizes 🌊 Best use of the LSP for stabilizing another protocol ⸺ $2,500 Liquid Stability Pool offsets the debt of liquidations in our CDP module, we believe we can bring higher capital efficiency to the $NECT sitting there by having other protocols (Perpetuals, Lending…) making use of that available liquidity, with the condition that it ends up being profitable to LSP holders. Develop a module that can plug into the LiquidStabilityPool::offset() function, ensuring that any other protocol can make use of its liquidity, without introducing any liquidity problem. Qualification Requirements Qualification requirement: Projects must have a description and a GitHub repository with a descriptive README. -- How your module safely leverages LSP liquidity. -- Why it's beneficial to both protocols and LSP depositors. There has to be at least one practical example of a known protocol making a sound use of your developed module that plugs into the LSP. Technically and economically sound. Code must be open source and modular enough to plug into future protocols. Berachain smart contract deployment.

Let users “set it and forget it”—but optimize for sustainability, yield, risk, and usability. Our product, Managed Leveraged Vaults (MLV), keeps the position collateral ratio constant, while depositing the debt into our LSP, and rebalancing PoL rewards into principal. Qualification Requirements Projects must have a description and a GitHub repository with a descriptive README. As ERC4626 compliant as possible. Technically and economically sound. Deployed smart contracts over any Beraborrow collateral. Deploy $NECT debt into multiple productive uses and not just LSP (It can complement but not anchor the strategy).

Prizes 📁 Build Fair Data Economy with Filecoin ⸺ $5,000 🥇 1st place $2,500 🥈 2nd place $1,500 🥉 3rd place $1,000 🗂️ Design AI systems that are trustworthy, ethical, and sustainable by tackling data provenance, ethical sourcing, and fair attribution. 🗂️ Leverage Filecoin’s decentralized storage and Data DAOs to ensure transparency, privacy, and equitable value distribution. 🗂️ We're seeking modular, interoperable, and agentic solutions across data management, decentralized computation, and real-world applications. Qualification Requirements Projects must store data on Filecoin through on-chain storage deals, by using the hot storage layer - Akave or on-ramp storage providers such as Lighthouse Storage, or Storacha. Storing solely on IPFS does not qualify. Solutions can be deployed on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) or on EVM-compatible Layer 2 networks that facilitate cross-chain storage to Filecoin. Additional credit will be given to projects that integrate with a data on-ramp contract to streamline storage onboarding to Filecoin from other EVM-compatible chains or building a data bridge from Akave to Filecoin where data flow works fully on-chain.

Thanks for the detailed info! To tailor a list of minimal MVP challenges for each sponsor, could you please confirm the following:
1. Are you looking for the MVPs to be Solidity-focused, or would you also like examples in Rust, Cadence, or JS where applicable (e.g., Flow, Nitrolite)?
2. Would you prefer each MVP to be deployable/testable within 1-2 hours (super light), or are 3-5 hour setups acceptable?
3. Are you interested in cross-chain / multi-protocol integrations at this MVP stage, or should I keep each tutorial isolated per sponsor's tech?
Once I have that, I’ll get started crafting simple MVP ideas and step-by-step tutorials for each sponsor's tech.

You said:
So I just want for each bounty mentionned above a simple MVP project idea + exact tutorial on how to accomplish this bounty It should be the simplest shortest fastest to implement isolated MVP with only each sponsor bounty, so that I can get my hand on their tech before deciding to work on them for the whole weekend. eg the goal is to identify low hanging fruits, or to spin up project ideas so, imagine the simplest possible MVP that would qualify for a bounty (eg if the bounty is about a cross chain app, then let's make the simplest possible cross chain app). The goal is to isolate each project difficulties, and then focus on the integration later on So no integration of multiple bounties just yet
