We simplify zero-knowledge proofs, making privacy and verification tools accessible to smart contract developers on EVM compatible chains. By integrating web2 data (web and email proofs) into web3 apps, we support a decentralized, secure, and efficient internet. We are on a mission to connect the otherwise disconnected worlds of Web2 and Web3. We are building a new category - verifiable data infrastructure. Our all-in-one infrastructure layer allows developers to extract, verify and integrate real-world data into Ethereum smart contracts, in the form of trustless claims. By integrating web2 data (web and email proofs) into web3 apps, we support a decentralized, secure, and efficient internet. Our technology is powered by state-of-art Zero Knowledge Proofs and optimised to provide the best developer experience. Key features: Time travel: leverage history of on-chain data in your contracts Teleport: compute cross-chain data from EVMs Email Proofs: tap into trusted contents of emails Web Proofs: bring private Web2 data on-chain Benefits of building with vlayer: You can use Solidity and existing tooling like Foundry No needs to learn new DSLs or programming languages Access the key data sources directly from your Solidity smart contract Prizes ü¶∏ Most inspiring use of vlayer superpowers ‚∏∫ $4,000 Create a dApp that uses verifiable data in on-chain contracts.

Designed for simplicity and flexibility, Beraborrow features modular, tokenized components that can be composed together to introduce powerful new features to the CDP design space. Prizes üåä Best use of the LSP for stabilizing another protocol ‚∏∫ $2,500 Liquid Stability Pool offsets the debt of liquidations in our CDP module, we believe we can bring higher capital efficiency to the $NECT sitting there by having other protocols (Perpetuals, Lending‚Ä¶) making use of that available liquidity, with the condition that it ends up being profitable to LSP holders. Develop a module that can plug into the LiquidStabilityPool::offset() function, ensuring that any other protocol can make use of its liquidity, without introducing any liquidity problem. Qualification Requirements Qualification requirement: Projects must have a description and a GitHub repository with a descriptive README. -- How your module safely leverages LSP liquidity. -- Why it's beneficial to both protocols and LSP depositors. There has to be at least one practical example of a known protocol making a sound use of your developed module that plugs into the LSP. Technically and economically sound.

Storing solely on IPFS does not qualify. Solutions can be deployed on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) or on EVM-compatible Layer 2 networks that facilitate cross-chain storage to Filecoin.

Thanks for the detailed info! To tailor a list of minimal MVP challenges for each sponsor, could you please confirm the following:
1. Are you looking for the MVPs to be Solidity-focused, or would you also like examples in Rust, Cadence, or JS where applicable (e.g., Flow, Nitrolite)?
2. Would you prefer each MVP to be deployable/testable within 1-2 hours (super light), or are 3-5 hour setups acceptable?
3. Are you interested in cross-chain / multi-protocol integrations at this MVP stage, or should I keep each tutorial isolated per sponsor's tech?
Once I have that, I‚Äôll get started crafting simple MVP ideas and step-by-step tutorials for each sponsor's tech.

You said:
So I just want for each bounty mentionned above a simple MVP project idea + exact tutorial on how to accomplish this bounty It should be the simplest shortest fastest to implement isolated MVP with only each sponsor bounty, so that I can get my hand on their tech before deciding to work on them for the whole weekend. eg the goal is to identify low hanging fruits, or to spin up project ideas so, imagine the simplest possible MVP that would qualify for a bounty (eg if the bounty is about a cross chain app, then let's make the simplest possible cross chain app). The goal is to isolate each project difficulties, and then focus on the integration later on So no integration of multiple bounties just yet
