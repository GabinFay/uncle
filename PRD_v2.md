# Product Requirements Document: Decentralized Credit Recovery Platform (v2)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a decentralized credit recovery platform aimed at addressing financial exclusion in Brazil. The platform will leverage blockchain technology and alternative data sources to enable blacklisted individuals to rebuild their creditworthiness and access financial services.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide a transparent and accessible path to credit recovery for individuals excluded from the traditional financial system.
*   Reduce reliance on traditional credit scoring by incorporating alternative data and social vouching.
*   Foster financial inclusion and empower users to build a portable, global credit history.
*   Create a sustainable and scalable micro-loan ecosystem.

## 3. Target Users

*   **Primary:** Brazilians blacklisted from the traditional financial system (e.g., due to past defaults, lack of credit history).
*   **Secondary:** Friends and family of primary users willing to act as social Vouchers; ethical investors interested in funding micro-loan pools.

## 4. Core Features & Functionality

### 4.1. User Onboarding & Identity

*   **World ID Integration:** Users prove their unique personhood via World ID (Orb scan) to prevent Sybil attacks.
*   **Profile Creation:** Users create a basic profile. Data relevant to creditworthiness will be added progressively.

### 4.2. Alternative Data Integration & Verification

*   **Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for Employment & Payments:**
    *   Users can submit proofs of employment (e.g., anonymized email verifications, platform-based work history) and utility payment history.
    *   The platform will work towards integrating with data providers or enabling users to generate VCs for this data.
    *   Initially, this might involve manual review or simpler attestations, with a roadmap to fully automated VC-based verification.
*   **Data Storage:** User-provided sensitive data will be encrypted client-side and users will control access. Filecoin will be explored for decentralized, user-controlled storage, ensuring data sovereignty.

### 4.3. Social Vouching System

*   **Vouching Mechanism:** Users can request Vouchers (friends, family, community members) to stake tokens on their behalf as a form of social collateral.
*   **Voucher Risk/Reward:** Vouchers share a small portion of the risk but can also earn a return if the loanee repays successfully.
*   **Reputation Impact:** Successful vouches and repayments positively impact both the loanee's and the voucher's reputation score within the platform.

### 4.4. AI-Powered Credit Risk Assessment

*   **Hedera-Based AI Engine:**
    *   An AI model, potentially leveraging Hedera's infrastructure (e.g., HCS for logging auditable data points, smart contracts for logic), will analyze various data points:
        *   Verified alternative data (employment, payments).
        *   Social vouching strength and history of Vouchers.
        *   Platform interaction and loan repayment history.
    *   The model will generate a dynamic creditworthiness score.
*   **Transparency (Explainable AI):** Strive to provide users with insights into how their score is determined and how they can improve it (within the bounds of preventing gaming the system).

### 4.5. Graduated Micro-Lending

*   **Loan Origination:** Based on the AI-generated score and social vouches, users can apply for small initial loans (e.g., $50).
*   **Smart Contracts for Loans:** Loan terms, repayments, and fund disbursal will be managed by smart contracts (likely on an EVM-compatible chain for initial development, considering Hedera's smart contract capabilities as well).
*   **Progressive Lending:** Successful repayment of smaller loans unlocks access to incrementally larger loan amounts, building a track record.
*   **Loan Pools:** Funds for loans will come from liquidity pools funded by investors or the platform itself.

### 4.6. Cross-Chain Reputation

*   **LayerZero Integration:** User reputation (built from loan history, vouches, etc.) will be made portable across different blockchains using LayerZero.
*   **Standardized Reputation:** Aim to develop or adopt a standard for decentralized reputation that can be recognized by other dApps or financial services.

### 4.7. Frontend Application

*   **Mobile-First Web App:** A responsive React/Next.js application, easily accessible on mobile devices.
*   **User Dashboard:** Display credit score, loan status, vouching requests, and educational resources.
*   **Simplified UX:** Focus on ease of use for individuals with varying levels of digital literacy.

## 5. Technical Stack (Initial Proposal)

*   **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (on an EVM-compatible chain like Polygon, Arbitrum, or BNB Chain for initial broad accessibility and developer tooling; explore Hedera for its specific strengths).
*   **Frontend:** React/Next.js.
*   **Identity:** World ID.
*   **Alternative Data Verification:** System for Verifiable Credentials (research specific providers/implementations, e.g., using existing standards like W3C VCs).
*   **AI Credit Scoring:** Python backend with ML libraries, potentially interacting with Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for data logging and Hedera Smart Contracts for on-chain logic or attestations.
*   **Decentralized Storage (User Data):** Filecoin (with client-side encryption).
*   **Cross-Chain Communication:** LayerZero.
*   **Supporting Infrastructure:** Node providers (e.g., Infura, Alchemy), indexing (e.g., The Graph).

## 6. Success Metrics

*   Number of active users.
*   Number of loans disbursed and repayment rates.
*   Growth in average loan size per user over time.
*   Number of successful social vouches.
*   User satisfaction and testimonials.
*   Partnerships with other financial service providers recognizing the platform's reputation score.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   Integration with traditional financial institutions for fiat on/off ramps.
*   Expansion to other countries with similar financial exclusion problems.
*   Development of more sophisticated AI models for risk assessment.
*   Gamification elements to encourage positive financial behavior.
*   Governance token and DAO for community-led platform evolution.

## 8. Open Questions & Risks

*   **Regulatory Landscape:** Navigating evolving crypto and financial regulations in Brazil and other target markets.
*   **User Adoption:** Overcoming trust barriers and ensuring ease of use for the target demographic.
*   **Scalability of World ID:** Availability and accessibility of Orb scanning.
*   **Data Quality for VCs:** Ensuring reliability of alternative data sources.
*   **Security of Smart Contracts & Integrations:** Rigorous auditing will be crucial.
*   **Filecoin Cost & Performance:** Monitoring storage costs and retrieval times for user data.
*   **Complexity of Cross-Chain Interactions:** Ensuring seamless and secure user experience with LayerZero.
*   **Economic Viability of Loan Pools:** Attracting sufficient liquidity and managing default rates.
